**Medical Report**

**1. History of Present Illness:**

The patient presented with a two-day history of fever and cold symptoms.  Follow-up reports indicate the development of a cough and body aches.  The description of body aches is inconsistent across reports ("bioady aches" and "bvodya ches" in the follow-ups suggest potential transcription errors).  Further clarification is needed regarding the nature and severity of the body aches.


**2. Medications:**

None reported.


**3. Allergies:**

None reported.
Diagnosis: **Preliminary Diagnosis:**  Upper Respiratory Infection (URI).  Further investigation is required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, particularly given the inconsistent reporting of body aches.  A more detailed physical examination and possibly further laboratory testing (e.g., rapid influenza test, complete blood count) are recommended.
