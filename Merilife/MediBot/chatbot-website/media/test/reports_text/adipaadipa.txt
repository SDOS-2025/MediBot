The patient presented with a two-day history of fever and cold symptoms.  Follow-up reports indicate the development of a cough and body aches.

Diagnosis: **Preliminary Diagnosis:**  Upper Respiratory Infection (URI).  Further investigation is required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, particularly given the inconsistent reporting of body aches.
